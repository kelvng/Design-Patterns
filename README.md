# Design Pattern

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

## Requirements

The examples were written in Java 8, but also tested in Java 9.

For the best experience, we recommend working with examples in IntelliJ IDEA. The Community Edition of IDE is available for free (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

After downloading or cloning this repository to your computer, import its root directory into a New project:

- Either through start dialog: Select "Import Project" option and skip through the rest of the steps.

- Or via the main menu: File > New > Project from Existing Sources...

After importing the project, you will be able to run examples by right-clicking "Demo" files inside every example and selecting the "Run" command from the context menu.
